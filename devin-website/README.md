# Code Louisville Front End Development Final Project
#devin-anne

	This project is a small biography for my daughter Devin Thompson. There are 3 seperate pages for 
Bio/Home, Images, and a Test. The Bio/Home page showcases a short paragraph summing up Devin's life so far along
with my personal favorite picture of her. The answers for the Test page can also be found here. The Images
page include links to some of my favorite pictures of Devin (along with links to download these images if I
have enoght time to do so.). The third and final page of my project is a short four question test that I created
using JavaScript. This is a true or flase test that inclueds two buttons that the user can interact with in
order to submit thier answer. When the correct answer is selected this will add a point to their score. Finally,
once all questions have been answered, a final message will display with the ammout of points you scored.
