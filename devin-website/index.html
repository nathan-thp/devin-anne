                <p>Devin Anne Thompson lives in Louisville, Kentucky and was born just across the Ohio River in Jeffersonville, IN on May 4th, 2020 to parents Nathan and Leila Thompson. Devin was born durning the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which limited her exposure to the world but didn't hold her back. She LOVES her mommy and daddy, and spends time with her loving family during the week and weekends.  Devin smiles at everone she meets and is always the center of attention anywhere she goes. She loves being outdoors and looking at green grass and trees.  She likes going for walks in her stroller, and loves putting everything in her mouth.  She likes baths and loves getting her diaper changed! She says words such as "agoo" and "abaah"; and even knows some Spanish words such as "agua".   </p>
